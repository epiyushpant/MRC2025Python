🌿 Branch Naming Convention
Each student must create and use only one personal branch using the following format:

> You will use the same branch for all assignments, labs, and projects throughout the course.

🪜 Steps to Follow
1️⃣ Fork and Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/epiyushpant/MRC2025Pyhton.git
cd MRC2025Python
2️⃣ Create Your Branch (if not already created)
bash
git checkout -b yourname-rollnumber
# Example:
git checkout -b sabina-21
3️⃣ Work on Your Task
Organize your work inside your personal folder. Suggested structure:

/sabina-21/
    ├── assignment1/
    ├── lab2/
    └── project/
4️⃣ Get Latest Changes from main Branch
bash
git checkout main  
git pull  
git checkout your_branch  
git merge main  
:wq   # (If a merge editor opens, this saves and quits) 
5️⃣ Stage, Commit, and Push
bash
git add .  
git commit -m "Completed assignment 1"  
git push origin yourname-rollnumber
📌 Guidelines ❌ Do not commit to main ✅ Use your own branch only 📁 Keep files and folders organized 🧠 Write meaningful commit messages ⏰ Submit tasks on time 💬 Ask in class or raise a GitHub issue if you’re stuck
